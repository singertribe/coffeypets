This little app uses Meteor. You'll need to install Meteor to use it:

https://www.meteor.com/install

Once that's done and you've downloaded or checked out this code, go into that folder and run:

    meteor npm install
    meteor
  
Then you should be able to view the app at:

http://localhost:3000

There isn't much there, so make sure you click the `Generate New Data` button!

Also, try opening the app in another browser window (or a different brand of browser altogether). Click the little X to delete some pets and watch what happens.
